# PureScript
> A C# Implementation of TypeScript

## Why create that?
TypeScript is more than just a programming language for me—it's a language I love. Its versatility, type system, and solutions to JavaScript challenges make it my go-to choice across a spectrum of projects globally.

PureScript was born out of a desire to not just use TypeScript but to truly understand it at a fundamental level. By recreating TypeScript functionalities in C#, I embarked on a journey to explore the inner workings of a programming language, turning learning into a hands-on and enjoyable experience.

## What Makes PureScript Unique?
This project is my personal playground—a space where I can experiment, make mistakes, and uncover the intricacies of language design. While it may not be suitable for production use, it serves as a creative outlet for exploring the boundaries of language implementation.

## Is PureScript for You?
PureScript is not designed for professional applications; instead, it exists to fuel curiosity and understanding. If you are passionate about programming languages and want to dive deep into the art of language design, PureScript might be a fascinating playground for your exploration.

For production-grade solutions, where reliability and extensive tooling are essential, TypeScript remains the recommended choice. Visit the [TypeScript Official Website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for a comprehensive and professional TypeScript experience.
